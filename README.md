Developed by: Usman Haider
GitHub Repository: Usman11611/Directory_Watcher_Project

Overview
The Directory Watcher Project is a Bash-based tool designed to monitor changes in a specified directory and log events in real-time to a JSON file. The script leverages the inotifywait utility to track events such as file creation, modification, deletion, and renaming. It is ideal for system administrators, developers, and students interested in system programming and event logging.

The project focuses on flexibility, real-time feedback, and structured logging, making it suitable for use cases like filesystem monitoring, auditing, and debugging.
